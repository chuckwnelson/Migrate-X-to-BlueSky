# Migrate from X.com to BlueSky

This is a script that will make a list of all profiles you follow on x.com then try to add them on BlueSky.

This searches for someone with the same username from x to bluesky, so obviously it's not perfect.

It will generate a log file that shows if it was able to follow or not.

WARNING: This is scraping your own profile. Definitely against the TOS of x.com. *Use at your own risk.*

# Getting Started

`npm install`

`npm start`
